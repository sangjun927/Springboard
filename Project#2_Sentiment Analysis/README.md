# IMDB Sentiment Analysis
Dataset 'IMDB_Dataset' includes features 'Reviews' (Independent variable) and 'Sentiment' (Dependent Variable). Build and optimize machine learning models which classify sentiment values 'Positive' or 'Negative' by analyzing texts from columns 'Reviews'. Try out different techniques such as CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, Word Embedding and BERT to properly classify text.

## CountVectorizer, TFIDF, and word frequency Analysis
1. Data load
2. Subset dataset to efficiently train the model
3. Define functions and Lists to train and test model
4. Metric output before cleaning text data
5. Metric output after cleaning text data
6. Frequency analysis

## BERT
1. Data load
2. TPU configuration
3. Clean and split dataset
4. Encoding
5. Tokenization
6. Build and train model
7. Validate the model
